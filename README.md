# Regression-Analysis

In this project I was given a dataset with variables that impact the birthweight of a newborn baby. In this project, I used the following models:

- OLS
- Lasso
- ARD

It was my first experience with machine learning and it was a quite challenging one. I enjoyed every minute of it!
